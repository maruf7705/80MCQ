# MASTER PROMPT: HSTU Admission Exam Chemistry - Strategic Topic Analysis & 80+ Score Optimization

## CONTEXT
- **Target Exam**: Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University (HSTU) Admission Test
- **Subject**: Chemistry only
- **Goal**: Score 80/100 or higher
- **Timeline**: 3-4 days for preparation
- **Syllabus Base**: HSC Chemistry curriculum

## PRIMARY MISSION
Conduct an exhaustive, data-driven analysis of previous year HSTU admission Chemistry question papers to create a precision-targeted study roadmap that maximizes score potential within the limited timeframe.

## RESEARCH PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Pattern Mining
1. **Question Paper Forensics**
   - Analyze ALL provided previous year HSTU admission Chemistry papers
   - Extract every single question and categorize by topic, chapter, and difficulty level
   - Map question distribution: MCQ vs Written, Marks allocation per topic
   - Identify verbatim repeated questions or similar question variants across years
   - Calculate topic frequency: Which topics appear in 90%+ of exams vs 50% vs <30%

2. **Weightage Matrix Creation**
   - Calculate exact mark distribution per chapter/topic across all years
   - Identify "golden topics" (high marks + high frequency + moderate difficulty)
   - Flag "time traps" (low marks + high difficulty + low frequency)

### Phase 2: Strategic Intelligence Gathering
3. **HSTU-Specific Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify unique question styles specific to HSTU (if any deviation from standard HSC)
   - Detect favorite topics of HSTU question setters (topics appearing 4+ consecutive years)
   - Analyze difficulty progression: Easy vs Medium vs Hard question ratio
   - Map conceptual vs numerical vs derivation question distribution

4. **Syllabus Cross-Verification**
   - Verify current HSC Chemistry syllabus (2025) against question paper trends
   - Eliminate obsolete topics no longer in syllabus (যেগুলো বর্তমান syllabus এ নেই)
   - Flag newly added syllabus topics (if applicable) with unknown exam patterns

### Phase 3: 80+ Score Strategy Development
5. **ROI-Based Topic Ranking**
   - Rank ALL topics using formula: (Mark Weightage × Frequency × Inverse Difficulty) / Study Time Required
   - Create 3 priority tiers:
     * **TIER 1 (MUST MASTER)**: Topics guaranteeing 50-60 marks if perfected
     * **TIER 2 (HIGH VALUE)**: Topics adding 15-20 marks with moderate effort
     * **TIER 3 (OPTIONAL)**: Low-frequency or high-difficulty topics for 80+ push

6. **Time-Optimized Study Blueprint**
   - Allocate 3-4 day study schedule mapped to topic tiers
   - Identify "quick win" topics: High marks with minimal study time
   - Mark "must-practice" numerical problem types that repeat annually
   - List critical formulas, derivations, and theory points per topic

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

### Deliverable 1: Executive Summary
- Total papers analyzed + year range
- Overall question pattern summary (MCQ %, Written %, Mark distribution)
- Top 5 "golden topics" that alone can secure 40-50 marks

### Deliverable 2: Complete Topic Analysis Table
Format:
```
| Topic/Chapter | Frequency (%) | Avg Marks/Year | Difficulty | Study Hours Needed | Priority Tier | Notes |
```

### Deliverable 3: 80-Mark Roadmap
- **Guaranteed 50-60 marks**: List of absolute must-study topics
- **Target 15-20 marks**: Secondary high-value topics
- **Reach 80+ marks**: Strategic bonus topics if time permits
- **Avoid completely**: Low-ROI topics to skip

### Deliverable 4: 3-4 Day Study Plan
```
Day 1: [Tier 1 Topics] - Target 50 marks coverage
Day 2: [Tier 1 Completion + Tier 2 Start] - Target 65 marks coverage
Day 3: [Tier 2 + High-value Tier 3] - Target 75 marks coverage
Day 4: [Revision + Problem Practice + Weak areas] - Target 80+ marks
```

### Deliverable 5: Actionable Insights
- Repeated question patterns (memorize these for guaranteed marks)
- Common numerical problem templates with solution frameworks
- Critical formula/derivation list (prioritized by appearance frequency)
- Exam strategy tips based on HSTU marking patterns

## CONSTRAINTS & RULES
- ❌ NO follow-up questions - provide complete analysis immediately
- ❌ NO generic HSC advice - focus exclusively on HSTU admission trends
- ❌ NO topics removed from current syllabus
- ✅ Data-driven recommendations only (cite evidence from papers)
- ✅ Prioritize efficiency: Maximum marks with minimum study time
- ✅ Account for 3-4 day realistic study window
- ✅ Focus on pattern recognition over exhaustive coverage

## SUCCESS METRICS
Your analysis should enable:
1. Covering 80%+ of expected exam content in 3-4 days
2. Identifying 15-20 "guaranteed" questions from past patterns
3. Strategic topic selection yielding 80+ marks with focused preparation
4. Clear differentiation between "must know" vs "good to know" vs "skip"

## ANALYSIS DEPTH
- Mine at granular sub-topic level (not just chapter-level)
- Quantify everything: Use percentages, frequencies, mark counts
- Provide comparative analysis across years to spot trends vs anomalies
- Think like an exam strategist, not a comprehensive teacher
